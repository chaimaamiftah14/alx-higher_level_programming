Higher level Programming Projects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This repository includes all the projects I've completed as part of the alx-Holberton curriculum focusing on higher-level programming.

High-level languages (HLL) are programming languages that allow for easier program development, operating in a more user-friendly environment. These languages are typically independent of the specific hardware architecture of the computer.

High-level languages provide a higher level of abstraction from the computer's hardware, allowing programmers to focus more on programming logic rather than dealing with low-level hardware components like memory addressing and register utilization.
